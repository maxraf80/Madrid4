Operating in Latin America, Spain, and Portugal, the company offers two services, one for corporate clients and another for private passengers.As one of the biggest transportation network companies in the Spanish- and Portuguese-speaking world.

    <string name="transport_definition2">Car2go is a subsidiary of Daimler AG providing carsharing services in European and North American cities. The company offers exclusively Smart Fortwo and Mercedes-Benz vehicles and features one-way point-to-point rentals. Users are charged by the minute, with hourly and daily rates available.[1] The service forgoes the typical centralized rental office, and cars are user-accessed wherever parked via a downloadable smartphone app.[citation needed] As of October 2016, car2go is the largest carsharing company in the world with over 2,000,000 members </string>
    <string name="transport_definition3">Taxis can be hard to find during late hours on weekends, especially if there is some rain. Unlike in other European cities, there are few taxi stands; just stand by the side of a major road or bus stop and wave your hand to signal an available taxi passing by. Available taxis have a green libre sign in the windshield and a green light on top. Official taxis are white, and have a red stripe and the flag of Madrid on the front door. The tariff is displayed on top of the car (a 1 during daytime, a 2 during the night, which become 2 and 3 on holidays such as Christmas Eve).There are also special surcharges for entering or leaving the airport/train station. Ask for the written table of tariffs and charges (suplementos) (shown on small stickers on rear windows, compulsory by law) before paying if you think it\'s too expensive.Be aware there are some taxi drivers that will do what is called la vuelta al ruedo which basically means they will drive you around or through the crowded avenues to increase the fare.</string>
    <string name="transport_definition4">Opened by Ana Botella, mayor of Madrid, on June 23, 2014, the service began with 1560 bicycles with electric assistance to pedal and 123 charging stations. In 2015, an extension process was carried out, increasing the number of bases to 165, as well as the number of bicycles to 2028, which ended in July of that year. For the new service have been extended in 70 kilometers the ciclocalles and ciclocarriles in the urban center of the city.</string>

    <string name="monument_name4">Plaza Mayor, Madrid </string>

    <string name="monument_definition1">Plaza de Toros de Las Ventas (often shortened to Las Ventas) is a famous bullring located in Madrid, Spain. Situated in the Guindalera quarter of the district of Salamanca, it was inaugurated on June 17, 1931. It has a seating capacity of 25,000. This bullring was designed by the architect José Espeliú in the Neo-Mudéjar (Moorish) style with ceramic incrustations. The seats are situated in the "tendidos".The price of the seats depends upon how close they are to the arena and whether they are in the sun or the shade (the latter being more expensive). The bullfighting season starts in March and ends in October; bullfights are held every day during the San Isidro Fiesta, and every Sunday or holiday during the season. Bullfights start at 6 or 7pm and last for two to three hours."Las Ventas" is located in the east of Madrid. </string>
    <string name="monument_definition2"> The Plaza de Cibeles is a square with a neo-classical complex of marble sculptures with fountains that has become an iconic symbol for the city of Madrid. It sits at the intersection of Calle de Alcalá (running from east to west), Paseo de Recoletos (to the North) and Paseo del Prado (to the south). Plaza de Cibeles was originally named Plaza de Madrid, but in 1900, the City Council named it Plaza de Castelar, which was eventually replaced by its current name.
                "It is currently delimited by four prominent buildings: The Bank of Spain, the Palacio de Buenavista, the Palacio de Linares and the Cybele Palace. These constructions are located in four different neighbourhoods from three different adjacent districts: Centro, Retiro and Salamanca.\n In the years Cybele Palace and her fountain have become symbolic monuments of the city.</string>
    <string name="monument_definition3">"The Puerta del Sol (Spanish for \"Gate of the Sun\") is a public square in Madrid, one of the best known and busiest places in the city. This is the centre (Km 0) of the radial network of Spanish roads. The square also contains the famous clock whose bells mark the traditional eating of the Twelve Grapes and the beginning of a new year. The New Year\'s celebration has been broadcast live on national television since 31 December 1962." </string>
    <string name="monument_definition4">The Plaza Mayor (English Main Square) was built during Philip III reign (1598–1621) and is a central plaza in the city of Madrid, Spain. It is located only a few Spanish blocks away from another famous plaza, the Puerta del Sol. The Plaza Mayor is rectangular in shape, measuring 129 m × 94 m (423 ft × 308 ft), and is surrounded by three-story residential buildings having 237 balconies facing the Plaza. It has a total of nine entrance ways. The Casa de la Panadería (Bakery House), serving municipal and cultural functions, dominates the Plaza Mayor." </string>
